# ts-ds-boilerplate

An introduction to a multimodal design tokens build with [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) and [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/).

This project boilerplate is not fully optimized and can clearly do better.

## Install

As it uses yarn workspaces yarn is required to install.

**All platforms**

```
yarn build

**Platform specific**

```

## Contribute

As this can largely optimized, I will continue to work on it. Still, if you have any suggestion or so, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.
